    Our reseach focuses on the theory of complex systems, from information processing in neural networks to disease spread in population networks. We combine the study of learning and self-organization principles in these two types of networks with approaches from statistical physics and information theory. We thereby aim to improve the working of biologically-inspired artificial neural networks on the one hand, and to face future pandemics and similar health crises on the other hand.

        A classical problem when investigating complex systems is to infer
        their properties from measurements. However, these measurements are
        subject to uncertainties. For example, one can only sample a tiny
        fraction of all neurons in a brain. We showed how such subsampling can
        cause systematic biases and how to overcome them with
        subsampling-invariant estimators. More generally, we employ tools from
        Bayesian inference to include the uncertainty of data, e.g. from
        disease case numbers, for reliable estimates of collective properties.

The authors predicted that the third governmental intervention—a strict contact ban since 22 March—switched incidence from growth to decay. They emphasize that relaxation of controls must be done carefully, not only because there is a 2-week lag between a measure being enacted and the effect on case reports but also because the three measures used in Germany only just kept virus spread below the growth threshold."

        We want to understand how living neural networks process information.
        Does this require emergent correlations of their collective dynamics,
        as prevalent in so-called critical states, or does it require minimal
        redundancy and fast responses, as observed for so-called balanced
        states? We revisited these opposing hypotheses by analyzing spiking
        activity using subsampling-invariant approaches (see above) to find
        that many species operate in a novel regime, where they could flexibly
        tune computational properties in between critical and balanced state.
        We study mechanism of how neural networks self-organize towards either
        the critical or the balanced state depending on task requirements - a
        property that we call “dynamic, adaptive computation”.

        Information theory provides a natural language to quantify information
        processing independently of the imposed semantics. Hence, it enables
        us on the one hand to quantify the computational capacity of living
        and artificial neural networks. On the other hand, it provides the
        formal framework to derive learning rules systematically. Learning,
        from the synapse to the network level, tunes the performance of living
        systems, and unlocks the power of artificial ones. However, current
        approaches are mainly heuristic. With our systematic approach, we can
        directly related the information-theoretic fingerprint to learning and
        to performance on specific tasks. This enabled not only to
        characterize how the collective dynamics (see II.) relates to
        performance, but systematically derive the learning rules that enable
        optimal encoding of input. This combined study of information theory,
        learning and performance in living and artificial networks promises to
        unravel the role of biological learning rules in shaping human
        information processing.

        With the outbreak of COVID-19, we were confronted with the challenge
        to contain a disease that was widely unknown. Identifying efficient
        strategies for disease containment was urgently needed. With our
        expertise on inferring spreading dynamics in the brain even under
        subsampling, we could quickly act and quantify the impact of
        non-pharmaceutical interventions on the reproduction number R in
        Germany. Since then, we have investigated, e.g., the
        “test-trace-and-isolate” strategy to break infection chains, the
        amount of measures necessary during vaccination roll-out, and the
        relationship between contact patterns and disease spread. Given the
        complex interactions between infectious disease dynamics and social
        dynamics, we increasingly focus on the impacts of risk awareness and
        the infodemic on the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease
        outbreaks.

              data-abstract="The traditional long-term solutions for epidemic control involve eradication or population immunity. Here, we analytically derive the existence of a third viable solution: a stable equilibrium at low case numbers, where test-trace-and-isolate policies partially compensate for local spreading events and only moderate restrictions remain necessary. In this equilibrium, daily cases stabilize around ten or fewer new infections per million people. However, stability is endangered if restrictions are relaxed or case numbers grow too high. The latter destabilization marks a tipping point beyond which the spread self-accelerates. We show that a lockdown can reestablish control and that recurring lockdowns are not necessary given sustained, moderate contact reduction. We illustrate how this strategy profits from vaccination and helps mitigate variants of concern. This strategy reduces cumulative cases (and fatalities) four times more than strategies that only avoid hospital collapse. In the long term, immunization, large-scale testing, and international coordination will further facilitate control."
